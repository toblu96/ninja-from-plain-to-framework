<!-- for more icons check here: https://icones.js.org/collection/all?s=construct -->
- <vscode-icons-file-type-html class="tab"/> **HTML** - bones of our website
- <vscode-icons-file-type-css class="tab"/> **CSS** - because style matters
- <vscode-icons-file-type-js class="tab"/> **JS** - would be boring without interactivity
- <twemoji-building-construction class="tab"/> **Web Page** - building our first webpage, learn basics of interacting with elements
- <arcticons-grid-drawing-for-artist class="tab"/> **Mockup** - basic functionality for MVP

<style>
  .tab {
    margin-right: 1rem;
